-- 055_hi_res_tile_art.sql — stop withholding full-size box art from the
-- surfaces that crop it.
--
-- Collection tiles and expansion cards render BoardGameGeek's <thumbnail>
-- (~150-200px on the long edge) into boxes about 145 CSS px wide, cropped with
-- object-fit: cover. At 2-3x DPR that is 290-435 device px asked of a 200px
-- source, which is the blur users see. The full-size art already exists —
-- _upload_to_storage (game_routes.py:68) re-hosts BGG's <image> AND <thumbnail>
-- into the boardgamebuddy-games bucket — but three RPCs never hand it over:
--
--   * bgb_collection_shelf (049) and bgb_profile_bundle (045) hard-code
--     'image_url', NULL on the branches served from the denormalized
--     c.game_* columns, because 020 cached name/thumbnail onto collection rows
--     and never the full-size art.
--   * bgb_game_detail_bundle (023) omits image_url from its expansions block
--     entirely, so the expansion reel has only the thumbnail to work with.
--
-- Fix: a LEFT JOIN to boardgamebuddy_games for that one column, and an
-- image_url on each expansion. No schema change.
--
-- Why a join and not a denormalized collections.game_image_url: the column does
-- not exist (020 added the game_* set to collections without it), so it would
-- need a new column, a backfill, and edits to both denorm writers -- and
-- 044_cleanup.sql:33-41 deliberately dropped the equivalent plays.game_image_url
-- as "pure write amplification". A nested-loop PK lookup for one column on at
-- most a few hundred shelf rows is cheap and cannot go stale. 049's
-- single-table-read goal was about killing a PostgREST embed, which this is not.
--
-- Function bodies below are 049 / 045 / 023 verbatim apart from the image_url
-- lines and the added join. bgb_game_bundles (043:230) delegates to
-- bgb_game_detail_bundle, so the bootstrap prewarm picks this up for free.
