-- 045_participated_play_stats.sql — make every play-derived surface agree on
-- one visibility rule: a play "counts" for a user when they LOGGED it OR when
-- they appear on it as a participant (boardgamebuddy_play_players.player_user_id).
--
-- That rule was already used by bgb_play_stats (039), bgb_user_stats (015),
-- bgb_game_detail_bundle (023), bgb_plays_page (039) and bgb_feed_plays (043).
-- Two places disagreed, and one of those was also miscounting.
--
-- 1. bgb_profile_bundle — right rule, wrong arithmetic. Its played_games CTE
--    reached play_players with a LEFT JOIN and then COUNT(*), which fans one
--    play out to one row per participant. A 4-player play the user logged was
--    counted as 4 plays on the Profile's "played, not owned" shelf. Verified
--    against a real database before and after this change. The owned/wishlist
--    LATERALs in the same function already used EXISTS and were correct, as
--    was status_map (SELECT DISTINCT absorbs the fan-out).
--
-- 2. bgb_dormant_collection — wrong rule. It joined plays on
--    `p.user_id = uid` only, so an owned game the user played yesterday at a
--    friend's house, logged by that friend, read as "never played" and got
--    surfaced in the Feed's time-to-revisit rail.
--
-- No schema change; both are CREATE OR REPLACE of existing functions.
