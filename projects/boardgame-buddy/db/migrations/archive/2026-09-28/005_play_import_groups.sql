-- 005_play_import_groups.sql — one card per run of identical imported plays.
--
-- The Settings play importer (migration 004) writes a play row per play, which
-- is what keeps every counter honest. But a note recording 106 games of
-- Carcassonne as tally marks produces 106 rows that differ in nothing, and the
-- feed showed all 106: one session card whose rail held 106 identical
-- polaroids, and — worse — five pages of everyone's feed pagination consumed
-- before any other play could appear.
--
-- This tags each run of identical imported plays with a shared
-- import_group_id, and teaches the two LIST surfaces (the feed and the plays
-- log) to show one card per run. Nothing else changes: the rows are still
-- individual rows, so bgb_user_stats, bgb_sync_achievements, bgb_play_partners,
-- bgb_hot_games and the other 19 functions that read plays keep counting 106
-- and were not touched. A nullable column cannot change an existing COUNT.
--
-- What counts as "identical" is decided client-side, at import time, and is
-- deliberately stricter than "the model said count: 58": a play with a score on
-- any seat or a note of its own is never grouped, because it has something to
-- say that the group summary could not. See groupKeyFor() in
-- projects/boardgame-buddy/web/domain/play-import.js.

-- Partial, like idx_bgb_plays_user_bgg_play: NULL on every play the app has
-- ever logged and on every future live write, so the index carries imported

-- `id` is in the index, not just import_group_id, because the representative
