-- 048_play_teams.sql — a seat remembers which side it was on
-- ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- A play has carried play_mode = 'team' since migration 007, and the Play
-- screen has had a team field on every seat for as long. What it has never had
-- is anywhere to PUT the answer. The tag lives on the host's local draft, where
-- PlaySession.applyTeamTag uses it to keep one side's win flags in step, and
-- PlaySession.toPlayCreate drops it on the floor. So a team night saves as four
-- seats and no sides: the play detail has nothing to group by, the scoring grid
-- has nothing to colour, and the one fact the evening turned on — who was with
-- whom — is the one fact the row does not hold.
--
-- Nullable, no default, no backfill. NULL means "this seat had no side", which
-- is every seat logged before today, every competitive play and every co-op
-- play forever. Nothing infers a side from a shared win flag: two people can
-- tie without being teammates, and a guess that is wrong about who you played
-- with is worse than a blank.
--
-- ── ON THE LENGTH CAP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- 16, not the 6 the client enforces. The 6 is maxlength on ONE input, and it is
-- there because the tag has to fit a --rg-col-min grid column — a layout fact
-- about the Gather screen, not a fact about the data. An importer, or a wider
-- field later, would hit a 6-char column for no reason. The CHECK is belt and
-- braces for PUT /plays/{id}, which writes these rows through PostgREST and
-- never passes through the normalization below.
--
-- ── WHICH FUNCTIONS THIS RE-EMITS, AND WHICH IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ────────
--
-- Three, each copied from its CURRENT definition, which is not always the
-- newest-looking file. 044's own header is the standing warning about getting
-- this wrong: CREATE OR REPLACE is happy to install a function that has quietly
-- lost a feature, and nothing raises.
--
--   bgb_log_play   ← 044_play_bgg_play_id.sql  (writes the column, echoes it)
--   bgb_feed_plays ← 031_feed_scoring_template.sql
--   bgb_plays_page ← 018_scoring_templates.sql
--
-- bgb_feed_plays is REQUIRED, not a nicety. Play.fromFeedCard hands the feed
-- card's roster straight to the detail popup as its seed and the popup paints
-- from it in the same frame as the tap; without the column there, a play opened
-- from the feed would show an ungrouped roster that reshuffled into sides a
-- moment later when GET /plays/{id} landed — the exact repaint that seed exists
-- to avoid.
--
-- Not re-emitted, and why:
--
--   bgb_finalize_session   hands p_payload to bgb_log_play verbatim.
--   bgb_import_plays       loops p_payload into bgb_log_play. Owns no INSERT.
--   bgb_session_bundle     reads play_session_participants, not play_players.
--                          The lobby table has no team column and the tags are
--                          typed on the host's LOCAL draft, so they do not
--                          exist server-side until finalize. Consequence worth
--                          stating: a spectator's live mirror shows untinted
--                          columns until the play is saved. That is correct —
--                          there is nothing to show them yet.
--   bgb_profile_bundle     (020_unscored_plays.sql) and
--   bgb_game_detail_bundle (030_game_viewer_stats.sql) both project a REDUCED
--                          roster that already omits round_scores, so the card
--                          they feed re-hydrates through Play.get anyway.
--
-- ── A NUMBERING TRAP ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- db/migrations/archive/048_play_client_key.sql exists, and a few code comments
-- saying "migration 048" mean THAT one. The archive is closed and new files
-- continue on the parent counter (archive/README.md), so 048 is right here —
-- but new comments about this work should say "migration 048 (teams)" or name
-- the file, not the bare number.
