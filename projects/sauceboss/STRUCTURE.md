## What This App Does
SauceBoss is a recipe companion for sauces, dressings, and marinades. The app has three tabs:

- **Sauces tab**: Pick a carb (pasta, rice, noodles, bread, potatoes, couscous) → browse sauce recipes with step-by-step pie-chart breakdowns.
- **Dressings tab**: Pick a salad base (romaine, spinach, arugula, mixed greens, kale, cucumber-tomato, shaved beet, quinoa, farro) → browse matching salad dressings.
- **Marinades tab**: Pick a protein (chicken, beef, tofu, fish) → browse marinades optimized for that protein.

All paths share the same recipe experience: step-by-step cooking cards with pie charts, a serving scaler (1-12 people), unit toggle (Imperial ↔ Metric), and an ingredient filter panel. The app was originally a React Native app with a local SQLite database; the retrofit moves the data to Supabase and adds a web prototype.

## Current Status
- Stage: Retrofit (migrating from local SQLite to Supabase + FastAPI)
- Web prototype: not deployed (was localhost-only HtmlPrototype)
- Backend: not deployed (new, needs Railway setup)
- Native app: exists but uses SQLite — needs API client retrofit

## Tech Stack
| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web frontend | Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS + Pico.css | `projects/sauceboss/web/` |
| Backend | Python FastAPI (shared service) | `shared-backend/routes/sauceboss.py` |
| Database | Supabase (shared project) | Tables prefixed `sauceboss_` |
| Native app | React Native 0.74 / Expo 51 | `projects/sauceboss/app/` |
| Auth | Supabase Auth (email + Google + Apple) | Optional — app is read-only without sign-in. Signed-in users can add sauces / ingredients, mark favorites, edit their own sauces. Admins (single-time `ADMIN_API_KEY` claim) can edit anything. |

## Data Model
All tables prefixed `sauceboss_` in the shared Supabase project.

- **sauceboss_items** — Unified selector table for carbs / proteins / salad bases. Type rows have `parent_id IS NULL`; Variant rows (e.g. basmati rice as a prep variant of rice) point at their Type via `parent_id`. Columns: `id` (text PK), `category` ('carb'|'protein'|'salad'), `parent_id` (nullable FK→items), `name`, `emoji`, `description`, `sort_order`, `cook_time_minutes`, `instructions`, `water_ratio`, `portion_per_person`, `portion_unit`.
- **sauceboss_sauces** — All recipes (sauces, dressings, marinades). Columns: `id`, `name`, `cuisine`, `cuisine_emoji`, `color` (hex), `description`, `sauce_type` ('sauce'|'dressing'|'marinade').
- **sauceboss_sauce_items** — Unified junction: sauces ↔ items. A trigger enforces `sauce_type ↔ item.category` (sauce→carb, marinade→protein, dressing→salad) and that links target Type rows only (not Variants). Columns: `sauce_id`, `item_id`.
- **sauceboss_sauce_steps** — Ordered cooking steps per recipe. Columns: `id` (bigserial), `sauce_id`, `step_order` (int), `title`, `estimated_time` (minutes), `input_from_step` (nullable int).
- **sauceboss_step_ingredients** — Ingredients per step. Mealie-inspired normalized shape (migration 063). Columns: `id`, `step_id`, `food_id` (FK→sauceboss_foods), `unit_id` (FK→sauceboss_units), `original_text`, `quantity` (numeric), `quantity_canonical_ml`, `quantity_canonical_g`. Legacy freeform `name`/`amount`/`unit` columns were dropped — joins emit them at read time for backwards-compat.
- **sauceboss_units** — Unit registry (migration 063). One row per supported unit with `id`, `name`, `plural`, `abbreviation`, `dimension` ('volume'|'mass'|'count'), `ml_per_unit`, `g_per_unit`, `aliases` (text[]). The Python module `routes/sauceboss/units.py` mirrors this table for in-process parsing — keep the two in sync.
- **sauceboss_foods** — One row per distinct ingredient food (migration 063). Auto-populated by `create_sauceboss_sauce` via `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (name_normalized)`. Columns: `id`, `name`, `plural`, `name_normalized`, `aliases`. **No density column for v1** — see `routes/sauceboss/units.py::DENSITY_TODO` for the wet↔dry conversion follow-up.
- **sauceboss_ingredient_categories** — Maps ingredient names to filter panel categories.
- **sauceboss_ingredient_substitutions** — Substitution suggestions shown when an ingredient is marked unavailable.
- **sauceboss_profiles** (migration 003) — Supabase-Auth-backed user profiles. Columns: `id` (UUID FK→auth.users), `display_name`, `avatar_url`, `is_admin`, `created_at`. Mirrors the boardgamebuddy_profiles pattern.
- **sauceboss_favorites** (migration 003) — Per-user sauce favorites (composite PK `user_id`+`sauce_id`).
- `sauceboss_sauces.created_by` (migration 003) — UUID FK→auth.users, set when a user submits a sauce. Never displayed; powers the owner-only edit gate.

**RPCs** (defined in `db/migrations/sauceboss/001_baseline.sql`, with migration 003 amending the sauce-related ones):
- `get_sauceboss_initial_load()` — `{ carbs, proteins, saladBases }` for the home screen (one round-trip).
- `get_sauceboss_item_load(p_item_id text)` — `{ item, variants, sauces, ingredients }` for any selection screen (one round-trip).
- `get_sauceboss_items_by_category(p_category text)` — Type rows for one category, with sauce count. Used by `initial_load`.
- `get_sauceboss_sauces_for_item(p_item_id text)` — Fully assembled sauces linked to an item. Emits `createdBy` (003).
- `get_sauceboss_variants_for_item(p_item_id text)` — Child rows (parent_id = p_item_id).
- `get_sauceboss_ingredients_for_item(p_item_id text)` — Sorted unique ingredient names across linked sauces.
- `get_sauceboss_all_sauces[ _full ]()` — Sauce manager listings. Emit `createdBy` (003).
- `create_sauceboss_sauce(p_data)` — Now accepts `p_data->>'createdBy'` (003).
- `update_sauceboss_sauce(p_data)` (003) — Atomic full-replace of a sauce's scalar fields, item links, steps, and step ingredients. Preserves `created_by`. Authorization is enforced upstream.

## Screen / Page Flow
```
CarbSelectorScreen
  → (tap a carb card) →
SauceSelectorScreen
  ├── IngredientFilterPanel (slide-up sheet, filters sauce list)
  └── (tap a sauce accordion) →
RecipeScreen
  └── PieChart per step, ingredient list
```

Web prototype (simpler, single page):
```
index.html
  ├── CarbGrid (6 cards) → click carb
  ├── IngredientFilter (tags) → toggle to filter
  └── SauceList → click sauce → RecipeDetail (same page, expanded)
```

## Key Business Logic
- A sauce is "available" for the ingredient filter if NONE of its ingredients are in the user's disabled set.
- Unavailable sauces in the React Native app render at 45% opacity and are not tappable.
- The ingredient filter panel shows only ingredients relevant to the currently selected carb.
- Pie chart slices in RecipeScreen are proportional to `amount` converted to teaspoon equivalents (see `src/utils/units.js` if it exists, otherwise `src/components/PieChartLegend.js`).
- `sauces.steps[i].ingredients` is the canonical source for both the per-step pie chart AND the flat `ingredients[]` array (which is derived by deduplication across all steps, preserving first-appearance order).

## Environment Variables
| Variable | Used In | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | shared-backend (Railway) | Supabase project URL — also used by `jwt_auth.py` to verify Supabase-issued JWTs via JWKS. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | shared-backend (Railway) | Server-side DB access |
| `VIBELAB_SUPABASE_URL` / `VIBELAB_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | web `build.sh` (GitHub Secrets) | Injected into `web/config.js` at deploy time so the Supabase JS client can sign users in. |
| `ADMIN_API_KEY` | shared-backend (Railway) | Single-time admin-claim secret. Compared in `POST /profile/become-admin`. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | shared-backend (Railway) | Comma-separated CORS origins (add Vercel URL here) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` | app/.env | Railway backend URL for React Native |

## Active Development Notes
- 2026-03-13 — Retrofitted into vibelab monorepo. Files moved: HtmlPrototype/ → web/, App/ → app/.
- 2026-05-01 — Consolidated 29 sequential migrations into `db/migrations/sauceboss/001_baseline.sql` + `002_seed.sql`. Legacy carbs/addons/salad_bases tables and the `scripts/generate_seed_sql.js` pipeline are no longer used; populate the sauce/item catalog from a production data dump or via the in-app Sauce Manager.
- 2026-05-01 — Added user accounts (migration 003). Supabase Auth (email/Google/Apple) gates the write surface; signed-in users can add sauces / ingredients, mark favorites, and edit their own sauces. Admins (claim via `ADMIN_API_KEY`) can edit/delete anything. The legacy bearer-key admin flow is removed — every `/admin/*` endpoint now uses the `get_current_admin()` dependency, except `POST /admin/foods` which is open to any logged-in user. Sauce ownership lives in `sauceboss_sauces.created_by` and is never displayed.
- 2026-05-06 — Native app **Phase 1 (read-only browse)** complete on branch `claude/sauceboss-mobile-app-nuWed`. SQLite ripped out. Pure logic extracted into `projects/sauceboss/shared/` (constants, units, colors, families, filter, fuzzy, pieMath, validation, builder, api, themeTokens, copy) and consumed by native via Metro `#shared` alias. New `app/src/store/AppContext.js` mirrors `web/state.js` shape. New screens: `MealBuilderScreen`, `PrepSelectorScreen`, `SauceSelectorScreen` (rewritten), `MealRecipeScreen`. New components: `PotIllustration`, `StepCard`, `ServingsControl`, `UnitToggle`, `VariantSwitcher`, `FormChip`, `EmptyState`, `LoadingPot`. Inter font loaded via `@expo-google-fonts/inter`; lucide-react-native for icons. Both Android + iOS Metro bundles export cleanly. Admin Sauce Manager intentionally web-only.
- 2026-05-07 — Bumped native app to **Expo SDK 54** (React 19.1, RN 0.81.5, Reanimated 4 + worklets, React Navigation 7, lucide 0.577). Added `react-native-url-polyfill/auto` to fix Hermes' getter-only `URL.protocol` that crashed Expo Go SDK 54 boot. API client defaults to the Railway URL so a fresh clone works without `.env`. MealBuilder header now respects `useSafeAreaInsets()` so the wordmark clears the iOS notch.
- 2026-05-07 — Native app **Phase 2 (auth + favorites + settings)** complete. Supabase Auth (email/password) wired via `@supabase/supabase-js` + `expo-secure-store` storage adapter. `AppContext` subscribes to `onAuthStateChange` and auto-fetches profile (creates on 404) + favorites. New components: `AuthModal`, `HeaderAuthSlot` (avatar pill / sign-in button), `HeartButton` (optimistic toggle, spring scale animation). New screen: `SettingsScreen` (display name editing, become-admin via `ADMIN_API_KEY`, sign out, delete account). `SauceSelector` gets a "Favorites" pill that hides families with no favorited member. `MealRecipeScreen` shows a heart in the timing banner. Auth UI gracefully no-ops when `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` aren't set so the read-only build still runs. Google + Apple OAuth deferred to v1.1 (requires EAS build pipeline for the custom URL scheme).
- 2026-05-07 — Step `estimatedTime` is now persisted on save. The
  `sauceboss_sauce_steps.estimated_time` column has existed since the
  baseline (read paths emit it as `estimatedTime`) but the
  `create_sauceboss_sauce` / `update_sauceboss_sauce` RPCs never wrote
  to it, so every step fell back to the recipe view's hardcoded 5-minute
  default. Migration `006_step_estimated_time.sql` redefines both RPCs
  to read `p_data->'steps'->>'estimatedTime'`. `StepInput` Pydantic model
  gains the field. Web + native builders both grew a small "Time / min"
  numeric input next to the step title; existing sauces edited in either
  app round-trip the value.
- 2026-05-07 — Native app **Phase 3 (sauce manager + sauce builder)** complete. New `SauceManagerScreen` browses every sauce in the catalog (open to all users), grouped by cuisine accordion with search + type-filter pills + favorites toggle. Logged-in users get a "+" FAB that opens a new `SauceBuilderScreen`; the row's owner (or any admin) gets inline Edit + Delete actions. New `SauceBuilderScreen` is a single-screen authoring form (basics, type/cuisine/color picker, item pairings, multi-step editor with `FoodAutocomplete` debounced typeahead against `/foods?q=`, URL import via `/import` + `applyParsedRecipe` from `#shared/builder`, live `validateBuilder` from `#shared/validation`). New `RecipeScreen` is a single-sauce viewer used from the manager (the meal flow still goes through `MealRecipeScreen`). Home header gets a "Sauces" button (chef-hat icon) that opens the manager. Backend gained `DELETE /api/v1/sauceboss/sauces/{id}` (owner-or-admin) so the native app can delete recipes the user created without needing the admin claim. Pie chart layout in `StepCard` flipped to side-by-side (chart left, ingredient legend right) to match the web app.
- 2026-05-07 — **Recipe import/export + edit-mode toggle** (web only). New backend module `shared-backend/routes/sauceboss/import_export_routes.py` adds four endpoints: `GET /sauces/{id}/export.json` (public, versioned envelope), `GET /sauces/{id}/export.md` (public, human-readable, one-way), `GET /admin/sauces/export.json` (admin, bulk dump), and `POST /sauces/import` (multipart JSON upload, logged-in user becomes `created_by`). Reuses the existing `get_sauceboss_all_sauces_full` RPC and `_build_sauce_payload` / `create_sauceboss_sauce` create pipeline — no new SQL, no new Python deps. Single-import accepts both the envelope shape and bare `CreateSauceRequest` objects; bulk envelopes are rejected (422). Cross-installation `parentSauceId` references that don't resolve locally are stripped with a non-fatal warning rather than 422'd, so backups round-trip cleanly between Supabase projects. Frontend gets a new global `state.editMode` (default `false`, persisted in `sessionStorage`, reset on logout) toggled via a pencil icon in the Sauce Manager header. When `editMode` is OFF the Sauce Manager renders read-only — no `+` FAB, no swipe-to-edit/delete on sauce/dish/ingredient rows, no long-press merge, no import/bulk-export toolbar; flipping ON reveals all of them. Recipe view (`recipe.js`) and meal recipe view (`meal.js`) both gain JSON + Markdown export buttons gated on the same flag. Export endpoints are public so anonymous users can still download via shared links — only the UI is gated.
- 2026-05-08 — **Import flow polish + tighter exports.** Sauce import now skips the server-side persistence path entirely: the web UI parses the uploaded `.sauce.json` client-side, populates `state.builder` (mirrors `openBuilderEdit`'s shape mapping minus `editingId`), and routes through the existing builder → review → `POST /sauces` flow so users always confirm the imported recipe before it lands in the catalog. Backend `POST /sauces/import` endpoint and its helpers (`_unwrap_import_payload`, `_resolve_parent`, `ImportResultResponse`) are removed. JSON exports now strip per-ingredient `originalText`/`foodId`/`unitId`/`canonicalMl`/`canonicalG` — all are derived server-side on save (`_resolve_ingredient_for_save` rebuilds `originalText` from `amount + unit + name`), so dropping them keeps export shape symmetric with what the builder edit flow already discards and shrinks payloads ~15-25%. Markdown exports still use `originalText` for qualitative rows ("salt to taste"). The "Add a sauce" `+` FAB on the Sauces tab is now visible to any logged-in user regardless of edit-mode state — adding new content isn't really editing. Edit mode still gates the per-row swipe edit/delete actions, the import/bulk-export toolbar, and the ingredients-tab `+`. Non-resolvable `parentSauceId` references are dropped client-side with a warning before the builder loads.
