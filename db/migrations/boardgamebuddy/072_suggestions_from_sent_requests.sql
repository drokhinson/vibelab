-- 072_suggestions_from_sent_requests.sql — a request you sent is a link too,
-- plus the second hop the onboarding deck pre-loads.
--
-- Both suggestion functions rank friends-of-friends over ACCEPTED edges only
-- (057/063/066). That is the right floor for a settled account and exactly
-- wrong for a new one: sending someone a request is the clearest "I know this
-- person" the app has, and until they answer it counts for nothing. The user
-- most affected is the one who has just been through first-run setup and sent
-- eight requests — for whom the signal is at its strongest and, today, unused.
--
-- So a second traversal joins the first: hop from the people the viewer has
-- ASKED (status = 'pending' AND requested_by = uid) over THEIR accepted edges.
-- Three deliberate constraints on it:
--
--   • It gets its own column, `pending_mutual_count`, rather than being folded
--     into `mutual_count`. The tile says "Mutual buddy" off that count, and
--     that sentence has to stay true — a person who has not accepted yet is
--     not a mutual buddy. Every existing caller keeps the number it had.
--   • The second hop is still accepted-only. Traversing pending→pending would
--     rank on two guesses stacked, which is not evidence of anything.
--   • `connected` is untouched, so the people the viewer has asked are still
--     excluded from being suggested back to them.
--
-- Both functions also start returning `via_user_id` — WHICH first-hop person
-- explains this candidate — because the tile line "Buddy of Priya" is the
-- honest version of a suggestion earned this way, and it cannot be derived
-- from a count. An accepted link wins over a pending one when both exist.
--
-- The third function is new. The onboarding deck (widgets/onboarding-deck.js)
-- promotes people client-side as the user ticks: tick Priya and the people
-- Priya knows appear in the grid in the same frame, with no round trip. That
-- needs their buddies IN HAND before the first tick, so the endpoint ships the
-- second hop for every suggestion it returns, capped per seed and overall.
-- Profiles are fully public in this app (STRUCTURE.md), so this exposes
-- nothing a profile search would not.
--
-- DROP + CREATE for the two existing functions, not CREATE OR REPLACE: both
-- change their RETURNS TABLE column list, which REPLACE cannot do. That takes
-- the GRANTs with it, so all three are restated at the bottom. Wrapped in one
-- transaction — a half-run leaves the Feed rail calling a function that does
-- not exist. Re-runnable. No table changes.
