-- 059_shelf_played_before.sql — let a game leave the Shelf of Shame without
-- inventing a play for it.
--
-- The Shelf of Shame card counts an owned base game as shame when the viewer
-- has no play rows for it. That is wrong for anyone whose gaming predates
-- their BoardgameBuddy account: a game played for a decade before signing up
-- reads as never having hit the table, and the only way to clear it was to log
-- a fabricated session — which would then land in the podium, the 26-week
-- rhythm heatmap and personal bests, corrupting four true stats to fix one
-- false one.
--
-- So: a per-collection-row mark, and a shelf block that honours it.
--
-- WHY A TIMESTAMP, NOT A BOOLEAN. Non-null means marked and records when, for
-- the same storage. WHY NOT status = 'played'. Migration 010 deliberately
-- removed 'played' from the status CHECK precisely because "played" is derived
-- from boardgamebuddy_plays everywhere in this app; reviving it as a stored
-- status would put two sources of truth back in the same column.
--
-- SCOPE. Nothing outside this function reads the column. bgb_collection_status_map,
-- bgb_profile_bundle and bgb_game_detail_bundle are untouched, so a marked game
-- still reads as Owned on every other surface rather than growing a "Played"
-- pill it has no play to back.
--
-- Otherwise this is 058 forward verbatim — same SQL/STABLE/SECURITY DEFINER
-- shape, same my_plays visibility rule, same grant. Only the 'shelf' block and
-- the new column are new.
