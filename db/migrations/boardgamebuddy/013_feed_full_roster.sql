-- 013_feed_full_roster.sql — put the whole play on the feed card.
--
-- The card has three faces and, until now, one of them was free and two cost a
-- round trip. The front paints from the feed payload; the back and the detail
-- popup each called GET /plays/{id} on open, so flipping a card showed a
-- "Loading play…" panel for a network hop, and flipping then maximising fetched
-- the same row twice (the card and the popup keep separate state).
--
-- What the back and the popup actually needed that the feed did not send is
-- small and specific: the SCORES. `participants` carries {user_id,
-- display_name} and nothing else — no score, no round breakdown, no avatar, no
-- is_winner — and it is filtered to the viewer plus accepted buddies, so a
-- ghost or a non-buddy at the table is missing from it entirely. Everything
-- else the two surfaces render (game, note, photo, mode, played_at, logger) was
-- already on the wire.
--
-- WHY THIS IS CHEAP. The roster LATERAL below already reads every
-- play_players row for the page — that is where winner_display_name and
-- participant_count come from — and it already LEFT JOINs profiles for the
-- display names. `players` is one more jsonb_agg over rows the query has in
-- hand. No new table access, no new join, no change to the plan shape that
-- migration 043 tuned (105 ms -> 5 ms on a 30k-play fixture) and that 007
-- preserved with the literal-interpolated LIMIT. The added cost is
-- serialisation, not I/O.
--
-- `expansions` IS a new read, and the only one: a second LATERAL keyed on
-- play_id, an index lookup per page row against a table with two columns and a
-- (play_id, expansion_game_id) primary key. It is here because without it the
-- detail popup still has to fetch, which would leave this migration solving two
-- thirds of the problem.
--
-- NOT A NEW DISCLOSURE. GET /plays/{id} applies no authorization beyond being
-- signed in (play_routes.py: "Any authenticated user can read a play"), and it
-- returns exactly this roster — every seat, ghosts included, with scores and
-- round_scores. The feed is strictly narrower: it is gated by `visible_plays`.
-- So this sends data the same viewer could already GET one tap later, to a
-- smaller audience than the endpoint that serves it today. `participant_count`
-- has always been an unfiltered COUNT(*) over all seats, so the existence of
-- those seats was on the card already; only their names and scores are new.
--
-- WHY `players` DOES NOT REPLACE `participants`. They answer different
-- questions and have different filters. `participants` is the SESSION GROUPING
-- KEY — feed-view.js groups same-day plays by the set of visible participants,
-- and the session header's clickable names come from it, so it must stay
-- filtered to people the viewer may navigate to. `players` is the scorecard.
-- Collapsing them would either leak a non-buddy into the header or drop a ghost
-- out of the scoreboard.
--
-- DROP + CREATE, not CREATE OR REPLACE: adding OUT columns changes the return
-- type, which a replace cannot do.

  -- Dynamic SQL for one reason: `lim` is interpolated as a literal instead of

  -- measured 555 ms versus 12 ms with the limit visible. Interpolating just
  -- the limit restores the estimate; viewer/cursor stay bound via USING, which
  -- is enough for a good plan. Injection-safe because `lim` is typed INT, so
  -- it cannot carry SQL, and it's clamped to a sane range below.
